# Wikia Activity Notifier

* Note: Don't confuse, Wikia Activity Notify is the desktop app, and Notifier is the front-end app.

This is the source code of WAN front-end. If you are looking for logging those RC
requests, you can contact to [the cube](https://dev.wikia.com/User_talk:KockaAdmiralac),
WAL (WikiaActivityLogger) is not longer working. However, WAN will restrict some
things like the number of wikis that you added, the HTTPS site, etc. Any bug or
feedback are welcome on Issues.

So, how can I run WAN on my machine?

# Installation

WAN can be installed with XAMPP, you can download it [here](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html).
You must know, WAN is portable but cannot be copied to another domain. Now,
if you want to make changes, you must "fork" this repository.
