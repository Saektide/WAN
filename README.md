WAL (WikiaActivityLogger) is not longer working. However, Tsundoku will restrict some
things like the number of wikis that you added. Any bug or
feedback are welcome on Issues.

So, how can I run Tsundoku on my machine?

# Installation

Tsundoku can be installed with XAMPP (or WAMP), you can download it [here](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html).
You must know, Tsundoku is portable but cannot be copied to another domain. Now,
if you want to make changes, you must "fork" this repository.
